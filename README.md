# COVID RESOURCES FOR VIZAG CITY

### With this COVID situation is happening outside, i feel that all the efforts of whatever we are doing should atleast redirect a bit to helping COVID patients and their family. 

### I have seen people losing their family members due to lack of proper and curated information. With this Project, I'm aiming to provide information related to Vizag. 
Why Vizag? 

#### Because this city doesn't contain good amount of resources like :

* Oxygen cylinders
* Ventilators
* Hospital beds
* Plasma donors
* Updated scientific information around the world
* other basic information for a person to know

#### My name is *Uttej* and I'm from Vizag and join me in this cause.
